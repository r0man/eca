# Installation

Eca is written in Clojure and compiled into a native binary via graalvm.

!!! info "Warning"

    ECA is already automatically downloaded and updated in all editor plugins, so you don't need to handle it manually, even so, if you want that, check the other methods.

=== "Editor (recommended)"

    ECA is already downloaded automatically by your ECA editor plugin, so you just need to install the plugin for your editor:
    
    - [Emacs](https://github.com/editor-code-assistant/eca-emacs)
    - [VsCode](https://github.com/editor-code-assistant/eca-vscode)
    - [Vim](https://github.com/editor-code-assistant/eca-nvim)
    - Intellij: Planned, help welcome
  
=== "Script (recommended if manual installing)"

    Stable release:
    
    ```bash
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/editor-code-assistant/eca/master/install)
    ```
    
    Or if facing issues with command above:
    ```bash
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/editor-code-assistant/eca/master/install | sudo bash
    ```
    
    nightly build:
    
    ```bash
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/editor-code-assistant/eca/master/install) --version nightly --dir ~/
    ```

=== "Homebrew"

    We have a custom tap using the native compiled binaries for users that use homebrew:
    
    ```bash
    brew install editor-code-assistant/brew/eca
    ```

=== "Gtihub releases"

    You can download the [native binaries from Github Releases](https://github.com/editor-code-assistant/eca/releases), although it's easy to have outdated ECA using this way.
